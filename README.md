# SalesDAO

SalesDAO is a Java-based application designed to manage sales records using the Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern. This project allows users to efficiently add, update, find, and delete sales entries from a data source, making it suitable for small to medium-sized business applications.

The DAO pattern abstracts and encapsulates all access to a data source, enabling seamless interactions between the application and its backend. This approach ensures a clear separation of business logic from data access logic, making the system easier to maintain, test, and extend.

Features
- Add Sale: Allows users to insert new sales records into the system.
- Delete Sale: Facilitates the removal of sales entries from the data source.
- Update Sale: Enables modification of existing sales data.
- Find Sale: Allows querying of sales records by specific criteria such as date, product ID, or customer name.
- DAO Pattern: Implements a clean and scalable data access layer.

  Project Structure
The project is structured into several key classes, each fulfilling a specific function:
- SalesDAO.java: The main Data Access Object class that interacts with the database or data source.
- AddSale.java: Contains the logic for adding a new sale to the database.
- DeleteSale.java: Manages the deletion of a specific sale.
- FindSale.java: Implements methods to search for specific sales.
- UpdateSale.java: Used for modifying details of an existing sale.

This modular structure follows best practices in object-oriented design and promotes scalability.

Technologies Used
- Java: Core programming language for building the application logic.
- DAO Pattern: Provides a structured way to interact with the data source.
- JDBC : It can handle database connectivity and store data permanently


Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java-supported IDE.
- Basic understanding of Java and object-oriented programming.
